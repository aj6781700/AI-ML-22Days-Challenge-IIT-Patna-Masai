Python programming & coding fluency

Version control & project structure

Control flow & statements

Vector algebra with NumPy

Optimization & numerical performance

Polynomial & multiple regression

Matrix operations & image processing

Efficient image transformations

Calculus & statistics for ML

Automatic differentiation

Pandas & data manipulation

Statistical testing toolbox

Data wrangling & cleaning

Matplotlib & effective visual storytelling

Fixing misleading or bad visuals

ML pipelines, evaluation & deployment

This repository will include daily code, notebooks, projects, and learning logs for all 22 days.

✅ Day 1 — Python Coding Fluency

What I learned today:

Wrote clean, idiomatic Python code

Used type hints & docstrings for better readability

Followed correct __main__ structure

Built a simple computation function (mean calculator)

Focused on clean coding habits required for AI/ML workflows


🧭 Daily Updates

I’ll be learning and posting progress here and on LinkedIn every day for 22 days.
Stay tuned for updates & improvements as I move deeper into AI and Machine Learning.

📌 About the Sprint

This challenge is part of my journey at i-Hub IIT Patna × Masai School, where I’m building strong technical foundations through structured hands-on learning.
